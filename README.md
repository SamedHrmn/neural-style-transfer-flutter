# Neural Style Transfer - Flutter and Flask API

This project contains two subprojects, the Flutter client project and the Flask server project. Flask is a MobilenetV2-based neural network application that uses a Tensorflow model and implements a style transfer by handling requests from Flutter.

## Known issue
There is one exception that is thrown by Flutter after making the request. It may or may not appear by chance. I couldn't find the source of the problem. If you find it, you can let me know.

Error: HttpException: Connection closed while receiving data
